# DisMAP-Demo
Demo of potential Rshiny App for creating DisMAP 

"www" contains the images, style, and plugins necessary to make pages look nice!

"Data" folder is where all the species distribution data would eventually be held

"app.R" is where the ui (user interface) and server (tells R what analysis to run and how) is coded up
