    <p>The NOAA Fisheries Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (DisMAP) is a national online portal which will  provide visualization and analysis tools, to track and understand past and projected future distributions of marine species in U.S. Marine Ecosystems. The Portal will allow users to view and download data, and dynamically interact with the data to explore changes in single species distributions, multispecies interactions, and availability to fishing communities. DisMAP will also serve as a platform for sharing tools and research in this important and expanding field.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Why a National Distribution and Mapping Platform?</h2>
    <p>Information on species distributions plays a key role in decisions by fisheries managers, the fishing sector and fishing dependent communities. Changes in species distributions are already being observed in many regions, increasing the demand for information on past, current and projected future distributions. Currently information on species distributions is dispersed and not easily accessible within or across fisheries governance boundaries.  DisMAP will provide a single portal for easy access to information on past, current and projected future distributions of marine species for use in science, management, planning and education. By providing information within and across fishery governance boundaries, the portal will support a variety of science and management decisions, such as stock assessments, calculation of survey indices, species interactions, allocations, and spatial closures.</p>
